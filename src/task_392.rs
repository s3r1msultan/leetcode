/*Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).



Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false



Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.


Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?*/

fn is_subsequence(s: String, t: String) -> bool {
    let s_chars = s.as_bytes();
    let t_chars = t.as_bytes();
    let mut j = 0;
    for i in 0..t_chars.len() {
        if j < s_chars.len() && s_chars[j] == t_chars[i] {
            j += 1;
        }
    }

    j == s.len()
}
